              1) The International Society for Logic and Artificial Intelligence
              (ISLAI), Chisinau, Moldova, and the Institute of Mathematics and
              Computer Science (IMCS), Chisinau, Moldova, will award, each year,
              prizes for best papers in logic and artificial intelligence,
              further referenced as “MPLAI”.
            </p>
            <p>
              2) Every citizen of Moldova, affiliated to a University,
              Institute, or Academy of Sciences, irrespective of their role,
              nationality, gender or age, are eligible for participation in
              competition for MPLAI.
            </p>
            <p>
              3) The prizes are awarded by an evaluating board appointed by the
              IMCS.
            </p>
            <p>
              4) Applicants are requested to submit an original (unpublished)
              manuscript written in English of a paper from 6 to 30 pages (one
              page approximating A5 size, i.e. about 800 words), on any topic
              that can be considered as pertaining to logic or artificial
              intelligence.
            </p>
            <p>
              5) Each year the number of prizes and their types will be
              different and will depend on sponsorship.
            </p>
            <p>
              6) One type of prizes will be awarded in those years when World
              Congress of Universal Logic is organized (“Unilog years”). This
              type of prize consists in 
              <ul><li>
                Covering the payment of the successful
              applicant's participation costs (travel, accommodation,
              registration fee) for the Congress, if the successful candidate
              will participate in the congress;
              </li>
              <li>
                 Recommending of the paper of
              successful applicant for publication in the journal Logica
              Universalis.
              </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              7) All MPLAI prizes will be awarded on January 14, World Logic
              Day.

              In order that applicants obtain most benefits from competing for MPLAI in 2021, which is a “Unilog year”, the organizers accounted for other two major events in organization of which ISLAI and IMCS participate in 2021:
            <ul>
              <li>
                VI International Conference on Mathematical Foundations of Informatics MFOI-2020, Kiev – an event postponed from 2020 to January 12–16, 2021
              </li>
              <li>
                Symposium on Logic and Artificial Intelligence (SLAI), Chisinau, January 14 2021 – an event associated and collocated in virtual mode with MFOI-2020.
              </li>
            </ul>
            
            </p>
            <p>
              Since the time frames of these two events intersect on World Logic Day, a person can participate in both these events. Namely, to participate in competition for MPLAI, an applicant needs to submit a paper by January 4th of 2021, 24:00, in PDF format, to the email address <a href="mailto:logicprize@islai.org" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">logicprize@islai.org</a> copy <a href="mailto:logicprize@math.md" target="_blank">logicprize@math.md</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              If the applicant does not advise differently, by default, we will send your paper also to MFOI-2020 in order for it to be considered for publication in Proceedings of MFOI-2020.
            </p>
            <p>
              Notice, that since 2021 is a “Unilog year”, in order to recommend the paper of the winner of MPLAI 2021 for publication in Logica Universalis, the manuscript must not be published elsewhere – it cannot be published in the Proceedings of MFOI-2020. However, the case of the winner of MPLAI is special, and this unique case will be managed by requesting that the winner prepares an “Extended Abstract” of his paper which can be published in Proceedings of MFOI-2020, so that the entire paper can be recommended for publication in “Logica Universalis”.
